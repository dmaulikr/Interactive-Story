Tiny storytelling

This was developed for a friend's storytelling class, whatever it was called. No, I wasn't doing his homework; his homework did not include writing the code for the app. The app was a mockup for the storytelling concept his team developed.

Runs on iOS 6.

> It's buggy. I already know.

The interesing part about developing this app was wrestling with a recursive stack of views.
